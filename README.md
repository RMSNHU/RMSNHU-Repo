- Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the application you developed. What user needs was this application designed to address?

The application is a course registeration program. The user needs to choose 3 courses to register. Each course is worth 3 credit hours, but the user cannot have more than 9 credit hours. Duplicate courses are also not allowed. The program was designed to accommodate for all of these restrictions. All course registrations and credit hours are displayed to the user as well.
